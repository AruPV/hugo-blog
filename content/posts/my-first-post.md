Hey!

I'm Aru Vargas. Thank you for stopping by my little corner of the internet :)

I've been going back and forth on what I want this place to be.
For a while I wanted it to be sort of [Project Xanadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu) inspired.
I still kind of want that, but the more I planned it out, the more I realized it was not going to be the fast, quick, static site I wanted my blog to be.

I'm almost certainly going to return to that idea, because I think hypertext is cool and the web kind of sucks rn, but I'm putting that in the back burner for now (will almost certainly keep adding entries about it as that project moves forward).

So, instead, I made this tiny blog in Hugo, using a template inspired by the [Bear Project](https://herman.bearblog.dev/manifesto/) (give them a look if you haven't).
I want this to be a place for me to put all the things I'm up to in one place I kind of mostly own (one day I'll self-host it but I do not yet have the commitment to the bit required for it).

So, what can you expect from this site? A bunch of things! but mostly:
- Snippets of projects I'm working on.
- My thoughts on random things I feel the urge to share.
- Some Korsgaard, inevitably.

Do you need to follow this? Not really! But it would be cool if you did :) I made an RSS feed in case you do, and will be adding entries somewhat regularly.

Some entries will be more polished than others, but I will attempt to keep them all relatively short, concise, to the point. Thank you for hanging around!

Aru
